# Java Gui Calculator

This calculator has only one class, contains various methods and a single constructor
This class extends the JFrame and implements the KeyListener, ActionListener was added to buttons.

The application can respond to end user events as keystrokes and button clicks. 

Added menu items (History and Help) where through history you can select previous operations or values and Help can give you the main hints.

It was a nice example to work a little bit with java.swing and java.awt.

# Ant config file
